# Senses
The Ra'firians have studied the effects of goldenberries for millenia. While the effects vary from person to person, there are three general themes:

## Sight
Those with the Golden Sight (that is a TERRIBLE name but I'm leaving it for now) typically lose their eyesight in some capacity. Complete blindness is not uncommon. In return, the Golden Sight provides some ethereal vision -- this may be a glimpse into the future, a vision of something happening elsewhere in the world, or a vision of the truth.

## Hearing
TBD

## Touch
Ra'firians Touched by Gold lose their ability to feel, physically and/or emotionally. In return, they are able to sense their surroundings. This allows them to react to physical stimuli in near-perfect ways, manipulate the emotions of others in a rather sociopathic way, predict changes in weather, and stuff like that.
